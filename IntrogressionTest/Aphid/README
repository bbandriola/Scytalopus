# Pipeline explanation: maximum-likelihood method aimed at quantifying the
# sources of phylogenetic conflict via topology and branch length analysis of three-species
# gene trees. Meaning that, you have to have all possible trees to each trio species. Aphid
# returns estimates of the speciation times and ancestral effective population size, and a
# posterior assessment of the contribution of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting to the
# conflict. Aphid basically asks whether discordant gene trees tend to be taller, indicating ILS,
# or shorter, indicating GF, than the majority gene trees. 
# Description above us took from the original article.
# ps: I had a few trouble making aphid to work. It was resolved once I installed libm library in a conda
# env with the following code: conda install hcc::libmatheval

# three files are needed gene-tree file, taxon file, control file
# 1. taxon file generation
python comb_trios.py > possible_trios.txt
  # 1.2 taxon file construction

# 2. gene trees selection 
  #2.1 count the size of every sequence from the 5kb int 100kb
  bash GetFastaLength.sh
  #2.1.1 get only the name of the file and the first line of the length
  awk '/^Results/' || '/^Sdiamantinensis127win5kb/' result_all_fafiles5kb.txt > output_result_all_fafiles5kb.txt
  #2.2 write all tree + file name in a file
  bash WriteTree_FastaName.sh
  # 2.3 get the name of the file + the size and add into the gene-tree file in the following form:
  # create a tab separate file with the extension *.in
  # name of the file: Sspeluncae_5kb_int100kb.in
  # tree; length	tree_name
  # do that with the procv command in excell

# 3. create config file 
Sspeluncae_5kbint100kb_config.toml


#4. run as bash with all files
./aphid tree_file taxon_file option_file outfile

#5. conca all results
# WriteAllTXTFiles.sh
for i in Lepi*.txt; do
    echo "Results for $i:" >> result_all_triplets.txt
    cat $i >> result_all_triplets.txt
done
