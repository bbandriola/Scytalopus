Methods:

1. GDI with PHRAPL (DOI:10.1093/sysbio/syw117)
  Software: PHRAPL
  Gene tree topologies along with a priori assignments of individuals to populations or species
  Choosing a model based on: AIC value and log-likelihood

2. GDI with BPP (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1093/isd/ixab021)
  Estimate species delimitation with and without a guide tree (A10 and A11 models) in BPP 
  To generate the control file of BPP: https://brannala.github.io/bpps/#/CtrlFile
  "program determines a sensible prior distribution for the θ and τ parameters based on the input 
  sequence data; otherwise, inappropriate prior distribution choices for θ and τ may affect the species delimitation results (Leaché and Fujita 2010, Chan and Grismer 2019)"
  "...Performed three additional BPP analyses (A00 model) to estimate the θ and τ parameters and used the estimated parameters from all post-burn-in MCMC 
  samples to estimate the probability densities of the gdi values.  The convergence among the BPP runs was evaluated using the checkConvergence function 
  in the R package gdiPipeline (https://github.com/dmacguigan/gdiPipeline). The gdi value for each post-burn-in MCMC sample was calculated using the R 
  script gdi <−1 − exp((−2 * τ/θ)) (Jackson et al. 2017, Leaché et al. 2019)."
  GDI calculation: "For estimating gdi values, the following two grouping strategies were employed. 1) I first treated each geographic taxon separately and 
  calculated the gdi values using the geographic taxon's estimated θ and the τ values from different nodes, which represented different stages along the 
  speciation continuum. This strategy was used to reflect the common practice of empirical studies that treated each geographic genetic groups as a candidate 
  of being a new species. 2) I also performed analyses that calculated the θ values by lumping different geographic taxa from the same lineage. The gdi 
  values were then estimated based on these θ values and different τ values. The second strategy was used to imitate empirical studies that may have 
  collected genetically distinct geographic populations for each species while assuming there was no intraspecific genetic structure (Leaché et al. 2019)."
